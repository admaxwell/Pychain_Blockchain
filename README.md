# Pychain Blockchain

# Machine Learning Trading Bot


This project uses visual code studio and streamlit to produce a python based blockchain digital ledger for a large bank. This program will come with blocksystem and in user friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.
